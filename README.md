Automatic speech recognition 
Speech is the most basic means of adult human communication. The basic goal of speech processing is to provide an interaction between a human and a machine.

**Speech processing system has mainly three tasks:-**

* First, speech recognition that allows the machine to catch the words, phrases and sentences we speak

* Second, natural language processing to allow the machine to understand what we speak, and

* Third, speech synthesis to allow the machine to speak.

*This focuses on speech recognition, the process of understanding the words that are spoken by human beings. Remember that the speech signals are captured with the help of a microphone and then it has to be understood by the system.*
